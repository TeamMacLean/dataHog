            <STUDY_TITLE>Identification of causative SNPs in the mob54-3/mob56-1BC mutants derived from bak1-5
                remutagenesis
            </STUDY_TITLE>
            <STUDY_ABSTRACT>mob54-3 and mob56-1BC were isolated in a forward genetic screen to look for suppressor
                mutants of bak1-5. The bak1-5 mutant is strongly affected in PTI signalling, such as PAMP-triggered ROS
                burst. The mob54-3 mutation strongly restores PAMP-triggered ROS and also other PTI related phenotypes.
                Furthermore, genetic characterization revealed that the mob54-3 mutation is semi-dominant, therefore,
                the affected gene is likely to be a gain of function mutation in a positive regulator of PTI. The
                mob56-1 mutation strongly restores PAMP-triggered seedling growth inhibition and also other PTI related
                phenotypes. Furthermore, genetic characterization revealed that the mob56-1 mutation is fully recessive.
                Therefore, the affected gene is likely to be a loss of function mutation in a negative regulator of PTI.
